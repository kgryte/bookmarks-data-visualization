Bookmarks
=========

A repository for data visualization links. Purposefully not exhaustive, but rather for visualization inspiration.

---
## Contributing

Within the 'data' directory, find the file: <code>template.json</code>. For each visualization, follow this template when adding to the file: <code>bookmarks.json</code>.

Feel free to make pull requests.

## Extension

For convenience, the repository includes a Chrome extension which loads all bookmarks within a single window and across multiple tabs. Obviously, beware that this may NOT be a good idea, as many tabs are opened simultaneously.

As the project grows, the extension may include filtering functionality to provide better control and streamline navigation.

### Installation

To install the extension, proceed as follows:

* clone (or download) the repository
* in Chrome, navigate to <code>chrome://extensions</code>
* select 'developer mode'
* click on 'load unpacked extension'
* select the repository directory
* you may need to either 'enable' the extension or 'reload' to see the new icon in your Chrome toolbar

### Usage

Similar to other extensions, click on the toolbar icon to load all visualizations.
